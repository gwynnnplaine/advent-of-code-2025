# Advent of Code 2025 — Solutions in TypeScript (Bun)

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), implemented in TypeScript and run with Bun.

Important: I do not use AI or autocomplete tools for these solutions - **this is a personal rule**. My goal is to solve each puzzle interactively and learn from the process :)

Why I enjoy this:
- Simple problems, focused code - no form validation or or SQL queries!
- Writing with TDD principles - tests first, then implementation. I love TDD!
- Feels like helping Santa and the elves while waiting for the holidays!

Highly recommended if you want a **fun, focused coding challenge!**
